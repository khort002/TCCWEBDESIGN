    <blockquote>
        <p style= "background-color:tomato;">If you are not sure what you want to accomplish in your life yet its okay. It is very important to gravitate toward what you love to do. Doing what you love to do is going to create prosperity faster than doing something parents , friends and society may push on you. You only have one short life so find contentment in making the decisions that are best for you. Even if others don’t understand your wants, needs and desires ,that’s OK ” </p>
